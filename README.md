# Greetings! ‚öú

The Filebrax Hub (which doesn't share any similarity with my nickname) is a fully functional project for handling file uploads and downloads on a server. It has been developed using Flask as its Micro Framework, with the goal of providing an efficient internal environment. Moreover, thanks to its well-structured architecture using Blueprints, it allows for easy integration of additional backend modules (e. g., [Tracker Tickets](https://github.com/victorbrax/TrackerG), a tracking and management application that I plan to release soon).
</br>
</br>


## Demo üñºÔ∏è

Soon, I will make available the main pages of the application in a non-functional way using the GitHub Pages feature for non-experienced programming users.

## Run Project Locally üè†

Assumes local installation of [Python](https://python.org/downloads) to run the project locally:

* Clone or fork this repository.
* Create a virtual environment. You can do this by using `python -m venv venv` in the terminal.
* Install the necessary libraries. If you use pip to manage your packages, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Run `python app.py`
* By default, the application will run on the following address: `127.0.0.1:8000`, with the debug mode enabled.

## Technologies Used üñ•Ô∏è
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
* [Blueprints](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/blueprints/)
* [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/)
* [JavaScript](https://js.org)


## Considerations üìù

* The system doesn't have an authentication module, but I believe that due to the modular architecture of Blueprints, it wouldn't be difficult to implement. If you feel comfortable, you can send me a pull request for the project.
* There is a deliberate project called "FORCE404"; you can try accessing it to test if the Flask error handler redirection is working correctly.
* The Uploads environment has validation for "port users" with JavaScript, Jinja2 and Flash Messages.

### Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
If the user tries to upload a project that already exists in the directory, the existing project **will be replaced** by the new one and a message will be displayed.

Note: My intention is simply to help people who are also studying web development with Python. :)

> Thank you for the prestige. üêç
